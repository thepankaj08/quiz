    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Answer: B
Explanation: A vertical section through different layers of the soil
is called the soil profile. Each layer differs in feel (texture), colour,
depth and chemical composition. These layers are referred to as
horizons.
The uppermost horizon is generally dark in colour as it is rich in
humus and minerals. The humus makes the soil fertile and provides
nutrients to growing plants. This layer is generally soft, porous and
can retain more water. It is called the topsoil or the A-horizon. This
provides shelter for many living organisms such as worms, rodents,
moles and beetles. The roots of small plants are embedded entirely
in the topsoil.
The next layer has a lesser amount of humus but more of minerals.
This layer is generally harder and more compact and is called the Bhorizon or the middle layer.
The third layer is the C-horizon, which is made up of small lumps of
rocks with cracks and crevices. Below this layer is the bedrock,
which is hard and difficult to dig with a spade.

2 Consider the following assertions:
1. The best topsoil for growing plants is loamy.
2. Loamy soil is a mixture of sand,clay and slit.
3. The size of the silt particles is between those of sand and clay.
4. Sandy soil is suitable for growing wheat, gram and paddy.
Which of the above assertions is/are correct?

    answer: `Answer: B`,
    exp: `Answer: B
Explanation: The best topsoil for growing plants is loam. Loamy soil
is a mixture of sand, clay and another type of soil particle known as
silt. Silt occurs as a deposit in river beds. The size of the silt
particles is between those of sand and clay.
The loamy soil also has humus in it. It has the right water holding
capacity for the growth of plants.
Clayey soil and loamy soil are suitable for growing wheat, gram and
paddy, as they have good amount of humus in them; while cotton is
grown in sandy soil and loamy soil, which facilitate quick draining of
water.
